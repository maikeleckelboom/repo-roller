# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md).

## Adding a Changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

or

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will prompt you for:
1. What type of change (major/minor/patch)
2. A summary of the changes

## Releasing

When you're ready to release:

1. Run `npm run version` to consume all changesets and update the version
2. Review the changes (CHANGELOG.md and package.json)
3. Commit the changes
4. Run `npm run release` to publish to npm

Or use CI/CD automation with the changesets GitHub action.
